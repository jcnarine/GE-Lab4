For this lab, I used the approach and method utilized in the tutorial 4 part 3 video. 
I basically created an observer that would check if the space button was being clicked 
and reset the music if it was or start the music if it wasn't. 
The singleton for my assignment kept track of the time of the application and
because of this, it would allow an overall play session time because it is always the same instance.
